# What is Cut?

Cut was created to take advantage of the increasing online presence of people, and the use of web-based technologies in behavioral and social science research. Broadly, I aimed for two things:

* **Usability**: Facilitate the use of engaging and sophisticated research instruments in studies,  by going beyond simple multiple choice questions and scales. Some available tools developed by psychologists and others are too specific in their use-cases, and narrow in their application. In contrast, other have developed platforms that are too generalized and require extensive effort and learning. A balance between these two poles was needed. 

* **Adaptability**: A second issue was running these instruments on different platforms and mobile devices. People today use their phones more than their computers for the majority of non-work stuff. Also, these devices offer access to a much larger population, in arguably more ecologically valid settings, at significantly lower costs. No one studying modern humans can ignore mobile devices.




This is obviously work in progress. Please check the [demos page](https://cut.social/demo.html) for detail.


I would love to hear your feedback. Lmk!
